		<p>YouTube video intros certainly display the creativity and style a channel may portray. Chunky Craft approached Pyxl design with a simple goal in mind: To receive a short intro clip that represented the channel in a few short seconds. Pyxl design took this as a challenge and came up with a truly distinct and complementing design.</p>
		<blockquote>Our intro, created by Pyxl design, definitely distinguishes our channel from others on YouTube. It's unique and it brings attention to our content. Thanks Pyxl!</blockquote>
